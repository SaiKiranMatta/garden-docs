## Contract Architecture

Garden uses Hashed Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs) to implement atomic swap functionality on EVM chains. The contract manages the lifecycle of a swap through four main operations with enhanced signature support and flexible initiation methods:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Initiate" icon="play" href="#initiate">
    Start the cross-chain swap by depositing funds into the HTLC on the source chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Redeem" icon="check" href="#redeem">
    Complete the cross-chain swap by redeeming funds from the HTLC on the destination chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Refund" icon="rotate-left" href="#refund">
    Get your funds refunded on the source chain, if swap does not happen within the settlement window. 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant Refund" icon="bolt" href="#instant-refund">
    Cancel the swap and get an instant refund on the source chain during the settlement window.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Functions

### Initiate

The initiate function creates a new HTLC by locking tokens in the contract. EVM provides different implementations for ERC20 tokens vs native ETH:

**Basic Initiation:**

<CodeGroup>
```solidity ERC20
function initiate(
    address redeemer,
    uint256 timelock,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 secretHash
) external
```

```solidity Native ETH
function initiate(
    address payable redeemer,
    uint256 timelock,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 secretHash
) external payable
```
</CodeGroup>

**Initiation on Behalf:**

<CodeGroup>
```solidity ERC20
function initiateOnBehalf(
    address initiator,
    address redeemer,
    uint256 timelock,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 secretHash
) external
```

```solidity Native ETH
function initiateOnBehalf(
    address payable initiator,
    address payable redeemer,
    uint256 timelock,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 secretHash
) external payable
```
</CodeGroup>

**Signature-Based Initiation (ERC20 only):**

```solidity
function initiateWithSignature(
    address initiator,
    address redeemer,
    uint256 timelock,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 secretHash,
    bytes calldata signature
) external
```

<Note>
Uses EIP712 signatures for off-chain authorization, enabling gasless transactions where authorized third parties can initiate swaps on behalf of users.
</Note>

### Redeem

The redeem function allows the redeemer to claim the locked tokens by providing the secret that hashes to the stored secret hash.

<CodeGroup>
```solidity ERC20
function redeem(
    bytes32 orderID,
    bytes calldata secret
) external
```

```solidity Native ETH
function redeem(
    bytes32 orderID,
    bytes calldata secret
) external
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
The secret must hash to the exact value stored during initiation using SHA-256. Once revealed, this secret enables the counterparty to claim funds on the other chain. No signature required - anyone can execute if they know the secret.
</Info>

### Refund

The refund function allows the initiator to reclaim their tokens after the timelock has expired and the redeemer has not claimed the funds.

<CodeGroup>
```solidity ERC20
function refund(bytes32 orderID) external
```

```solidity Native ETH
function refund(bytes32 orderID) external
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Uses absolute block numbers for timelock, which provides predictable settlement windows based on consistent block production times.
</Note>

### Instant Refund

The instant refund function provides a way for the redeemer to consent to canceling the swap before the timelock expires using EIP712 signatures.

<CodeGroup>
```solidity ERC20
function instantRefund(
    bytes32 orderID,
    bytes calldata signature
) external
```

```solidity Native ETH
function instantRefund(
    bytes32 orderID,
    bytes calldata signature
) external
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Requires the redeemer's EIP712 signature to prevent unauthorized instant refunds. This ensures mutual consent before the settlement window expires.
</Warning>

## EVM-Specific Features

### Order State Management

Both contracts use a struct to store swap state with different address types for native vs ERC20 handling:

<CodeGroup>
```solidity ERC20
struct Order {
    address initiator;
    address redeemer;
    uint256 initiatedAt;
    uint256 timelock;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 fulfilledAt;
}
```

```solidity Native ETH
struct Order {
    address payable initiator;
    address payable redeemer;
    uint256 initiatedAt;
    uint256 timelock;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 fulfilledAt;
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Token Handling Differences

**ERC20 Implementation:**
- Uses SafeERC20 for secure token transfers
- Requires token approval before initiation
- Transfers tokens via `transferFrom` and `transfer`

**Native ETH Implementation:**
- Uses `payable` functions and `msg.value`
- Direct ETH transfers via `.transfer()`
- No approval required

<Tip>
The native ETH version simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need for token approvals, while the ERC20 version provides compatibility with all standard tokens.
</Tip>

### EIP712 Signature Support

Both contracts implement EIP712 for secure off-chain message signing:

```solidity
bytes32 private constant _REFUND_TYPEHASH = keccak256("Refund(bytes32 orderId)");

function instantRefundDigest(bytes32 orderID) public view returns (bytes32) {
    return _hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(abi.encode(_REFUND_TYPEHASH, orderID)));
}
```

### Event Logging

Both contracts emit identical events for each state transition to enable efficient off-chain monitoring:

```solidity
event Initiated(bytes32 indexed orderID);
event Redeemed(bytes32 indexed orderID, bytes secret);
event Refunded(bytes32 indexed orderID);
```

### Order ID Generation

Unique order identifiers are generated using SHA-256 hashing with chain-specific parameters:

```solidity
bytes32 orderID = sha256(abi.encode(
    block.chainid, 
    secretHash, 
    initiator, 
    redeemer, 
    timelock, 
    amount
));
```

<Check>
Chain ID inclusion prevents cross-chain replay attacks, while the parameter combination ensures each order is uniquely identifiable across the network.
