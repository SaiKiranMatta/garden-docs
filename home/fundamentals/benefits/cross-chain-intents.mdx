title: "Cross-chain Intents"
description: "Learn how Garden enables flexible trading intents across any assets and chains"
---

Garden allows users to express any trading intent, regardless of the assets or chains involved, and seamlessly match them with complementary intents across its decentralized network. This flexibility extends beyond single-chain systems, enabling true cross-chain trading, including compatibility with complex UTXO chains like Bitcoin.

Garden's design supports a broad range of trading intents, whether you're looking to:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Major Asset Swaps" icon="bitcoin">
    Swap Bitcoin for Ethereum across different networks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cross-chain Token Trading" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Exchange niche tokens across chains, such as moving from Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Ethereum to Bonk (BONK) on Solana
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-step Trades" icon="route">
    Complete multi-step trades that involve intermediate assets like USDC
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
No matter how specific or complex your trading intent, Garden's [xCoW mechanism](/home/fundamentals/how-it-works/cross-chain-coincidence-of-wants-xcow) ensures it can be matched efficiently.
